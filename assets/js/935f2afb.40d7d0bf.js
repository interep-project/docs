Groups are basically sets of user identities organized as Merkle trees. What makes these groups extremely useful is the fact that users can prove that they belong to them without revealing their identity. This is possible thanks to the use of so-called ZK-Snarks and Semaphore.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"technical-reference/groups/oauth":{"id":"technical-reference/groups/oauth","title":"OAuth","description":"Users who have Reddit, Twitter or Github accounts can access Interep with OAuth authentication.

However, calculating it is not an easy task, at least as far as social networks are concerned. Some parameters are easier to fake and others do not offer an objective representation of the user\'s reputation. Our methods try to select the most suitable parameters and calculate a score that falls into one of the following categories (or reputation levels): gold, silver, bronze. Parameters such as followers, likes, stars can then be used to obtain a score that can best represent the authenticity of a user. The following paragraphs describe the criteria used by the social media platforms supported by Interep.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"technical-reference/reputation/reddit":{"id":"technical-reference/reputation/reddit","title":"Reddit","description":"Parameters","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"technical-reference/reputation/twitter":{"id":"technical-reference/reputation/twitter","title":"Twitter","description":"Parameters","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
